The error indicates that PowerShell's execution policy is preventing the `npx` command from running. This happens because script execution is disabled or restricted by default on your system.

### Steps to Resolve:

1. **Check Current Execution Policy**:
   Run the following command to see your current execution policy:
   ```powershell
   Get-ExecutionPolicy
   ```
   It might return something like `Restricted`.

2. **Set Execution Policy to Unrestricted or RemoteSigned**:
   To allow scripts to run, change the execution policy:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
   ```
   - `RemoteSigned` allows locally created scripts to run and requires downloaded scripts to be signed by a trusted publisher.
   - If `RemoteSigned` doesn't work, you can use `Unrestricted` as a temporary measure:
     ```powershell
     Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
     ```

3. **Confirm the Change**:
   Verify the new execution policy:
   ```powershell
   Get-ExecutionPolicy
   ```

4. **Retry the Command**:
   Run your `npx create-next-app@latest` command again.

### Additional Notes:
- You only need to set this once unless the policy is reset.
- If you're working in a corporate environment, you might need administrator privileges or approval to change this setting.
- Avoid setting the execution policy to `Unrestricted` permanently as it can pose a security risk.
